

its events calendar  that have the year 2025 init 
it will be displayed as only one month and under it will be options  to go to the next month on the previous  

and one final option that allows the user to add new event 
the event will have 3 parts 
date in this format dd/mm/yyyy 
and name of the event 
and priority on scale from 1 to 5 where 1 is the most important 

then after adding the event it will display the month again with the new events added 
make the layout shows what events is more important than other 
and the same day could have multiple events 


the most importnate part is the code will be in multiple function s 

the add function  which have the functionality to add new event  and the code MUST  have Priority Queues  


the edit function  that  have the functionality to edit any event by asking the user the date of the event and take the new data to edit the event  ,the code of this function  MUST use arrays 



the clean up function  that will check if the current date and mark all the old event's  as passed away in the design of the month , the code of this function  MUST use linked list  



the main function  that all the other function s and displays the calendar  to show it to the user along  with the menu  , the code in  main function  MUST  use hash tables 



notes , be careful about  error handling and to check if the user enters current data 


the display will be in the console but i need it to by as nice and modern as possible
